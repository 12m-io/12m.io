# Sensor Kubernetes/contaniers runtime


## How our contianers move
is our contianer beving as expected ore it trying to open a new port ore running som new command. We can deploy tools to minitor our apps how they befaved inside the cluster and if we detect any strange behavior we can alert by sending data to the highground.


## Deploy policy based system like https://falco.org/ to protect you apps in runtime
