# 12 Monkeys Kubernetes and Modern Security


## Before and after 

We se that we have two places that we need to work with security and we simpel called them before and after (at run).
With before that we work on verifying what we are putting inside our container when we build them.
This include trying to verify 3 party libs that we include. Diffrent framework that we use.

We also are trying to move the security from the devs laptop with antivirus and firewalsl to the build server.
The buildserver is a battefield we have 100 controll over and its here we will take the fight to work that no bad stuff are inside our code and hit our cluster.



Will we all now that during the time of our apps things happena and after (at run) is focusing on how we can detect and take actions when we detect unwanted actions inside our cluster.
To detect any bad things happening at run we need sensor running inside our cluster that always send us update info how aor apps and service are. And as soon as we see any thing that dont belong we should be alerted and take actions.


## The 12 Monkeys

The 12 monkeys are what we think is 12 good practises you should work in before and after when you build secure apps that should run in the cluster.
In include how you can work on detecing bad libs that you include. To script that will help you protect you.



## Welcome lets work toghter

The wold of securing our apps are updating al the time. And we are strongest toghter and there should med mpre off us protecting our apps then attacing them.
With thet we want your help expanding and adding more data into the 12 monkeys.
