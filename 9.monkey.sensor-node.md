# Sensor Node


## Sensor to get node data
Sensor are the compnets that collect data and then send on to the highground.
Node sensor arel called HIDS (Host Indtruc Detect system) 

For us its a demaon set that mounts some of the nodes logs folders and config folder.
Then ir runns scans to verify that configfiles are not changes. And monitor logfiles to alert if the node is logging something bad.

The hids are not processing any of the docker images log but only the nodes log it self.


## Wazuh
We usully use wazuh HIDS that are connect to our ELK HighGround setup
https://wazuh.com/


Wazuh read the node data and send it to the wazuh master. Tha master reads the data and will add alerts to data sent from the nodes. Data are then passed to a logstash and forwarrded to Elastic HighGround.


## Why

Protect the nodes /etc folder and detect any change
Montor nodes logfiles and detect any ssh logins ore file changing on the node

Problems
Hids in the old days was run on the node and started lisen for open ports and processes to detect if any new port was open ore any new prcoess was started. Now in the kubernetes we can detect this and kubernetes will move pods around and that will create new prcoess and open new ports.


But by locking the nodes dont and only allow kubernetes to controll the node we dont need this checks on the node.
