# 1 Monkey - Nodes



## Nodes as cattel
I node should be a replaceable instance that can be delete ore started any time. All setup and configurations is to be done in startup and kubernetes should tell what is running on the node


## Nodes are cpu and memory

Here we lower the nodes into a running cpu and memory and only something that add this into the cluster.
The node should not have any state and be ready to shutdown and detroyd anytime. All config is to be done with configtools like cloud-init ore other config values.

## Controled only by Kubernetes
The only servic that are to run are the kubernetes needed service like docker network and logs. No admin access like SSH ore other server are to run into the node.
If any service need to run on the node they should be deployed and run by kubernetes as pod in deamonset.
