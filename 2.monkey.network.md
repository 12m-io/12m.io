# 2 Monkey Network

## Deafult to DENY
Network deny all and allow whats needed. By default network in the cluster should restrict all traffic and then open the traffic that the service need to communicate. 

## Lets kubernetes ore service mesh allow traffic

By restricting the network traffice to the least allowd traffice and that so that our service work. we get a more controlled, secure and stabil network in the pods. With the kubernetes policys and other service mesh setting network polices are now easy.

## The app request network access
Let the service / app request the network access i need to work.
