## Alerts actions 

When we detect that we have an alert it can be a intruder allready inside our system ore something si starting testing our security system.


## Try again !
We want our security to be build on fast and reliabel code and if we have this correct we shoul be able to deploy fast and still keep uptime.
We called it "Flush it out !" so when we see bad actions we will start detecting how they get foothole in our enviroment and also start pushing out new deployments and nodes so the foothole is as short as possible. And by detecting how the attacer get foothole we can start adidng protecting messures. Code changes, firewall updates and more.

Active Security by flushing out and deploy new.


## Active respond 
To be well proteced we need to also be able to take simpel actions if we see that we unwanted visitors.

- A tool for blocking ip traffic
- A tool to detect and to slow down traffic  
- A JS / webb app so that we can deploy an extra layer of security webbpages
- 2 way access o the cluster we we can split traffic (aws loadbalanser ore DNS )
