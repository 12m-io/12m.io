# Sensor network / Traffic

## Network Detect (NIDS)

By adding a NIDS a network indrusing detect system we can monitor our network and alert if se detect any bad traffic.
This is extra hard into kubernetest network and here we use two diffrent types of types.


## TAP nodes network
The easy taks is to deploy a NIDS that opens a tap on the Kubernetes host and then get all the pod traffic and passed it along to the monitoring system.
We deploy our IDs like https://www.owlh.net/ and let is pass along all data to our wazuh data and to our highground.


## Front app
Sometimes we use encrypoted data and the TAP easy function dont work ore we want to get other data. here we can use sidecars to deploy IDS and web close to our apps.
Example to deploy a ModSecurity WAF and pass the data into Highground for monitoring.
