# Highground where we detect


## Highground
When running our cluster we want to detect if something is not well. And we do that by adding alot of diffrent sensors and then collect our data into one place that we can analys it.
Here we use the Elatic for this and call it the HighGround.




## For both people and machines
The highground is there to collect thta data from all the sensors and to store and to visulize thta data for admins. But it shouls also be able for apps to query the data to get knowledge in active status.


Example: “ An app can ask have this ip bean sean by any other apps doing something bad “

It can also be used to detect new type off events and react to the new setup

Example “We see a high number of failed logins : Firewall add delays on ip 1.1.1.2”
