#One pipeline to prod for apps and service 


## At buildserver we set the rules
Today code can configurtaions will come form many places. Developers laptop from github repos and other service. And to control and secury all the diffrent sources are a inpossible fight for the security team.

So by changing and taking the fight to the build server that you can controll is a better ide.
Here we can scan code and run test so that what we build dont inclue any security ore know problems.
In the build server we also can apply best practice and policy to our containers example remove libs and user access.


## One why into PROD for everything!
And to run one pipline to add any change to the cluster we have a controlled and security way of deploying into the cluster. 


## Same ACCES for EVERYBODY 
By allowing the build server to deploy both infrastrcture and apps into the cluster ore server setup we can grant ALL USERS THE SAME ACCESS.
Changes are done by version controlled changes and deploy by build server this will remove all blocked actions between devs and ops.
